# Nexora - Waypoint

> **Smarter decisions. Better deliveries.**

Waypoint is an intelligent delivery planning and operations platform built for Waypoint Group as part of **Tech-Triathlon 2026**.

It connects the complete delivery workflow in one system:

**Order → Plan → Allocate → Load → Deliver → Confirm**

Instead of relying on spreadsheets, phone calls, and printed run sheets, Waypoint gives dispatchers, loaders, drivers, and store managers a shared operational view.

## 🚚 What Waypoint Solves

Waypoint helps manage a delivery network where capacity is limited and every decision matters.

The platform considers:

- Vehicle weight & volume capacity
- Refrigerated / ambient requirements
- Outlet access restrictions
- Delivery windows
- Depot & district constraints
- Vehicle trip limits
- Order deferrals
- Delivery progress
- Offline field operations

When demand exceeds capacity, Waypoint doesn't just defer an order — it records **why** and keeps the decision traceable.

Every action feeds the next stage of the operation.

## 🧠 Intelligent Planning

Waypoint's allocation engine evaluates operational constraints before assigning orders to vehicles and trips.

```text

```

The goal is not simply to find a plan — but to create a **feasible and explainable plan**.

## 📡 Built for the Real World

Drivers may lose connectivity while on the road.

Waypoint supports offline delivery operations, allowing drivers to record delivery events and proof of delivery locally before synchronizing when connectivity returns.

Online → Offline → Work Locally → Reconnect → Sync
```

## 📊 Predictive Intelligence

The Datathon component explores:

* Delivery service-time prediction
* Late-arrival probability
* Future demand forecasting
* Peak-day fleet allocation

These capabilities can help Waypoint plan ahead instead of reacting after problems occur.

## ⚡ Getting Started

```bash
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd <REPOSITORY_NAME>

cp .env.example .env

docker compose up
```

Docker Compose starts the application, database, and seed data.

## 🎯 Judge Walkthrough

The complete workflow can be demonstrated using the seeded accounts:

1. **Store Manager** → Create an order
2. **Dispatcher** → Plan and allocate deliveries
3. **Loader** → Load the assigned vehicle
4. **Driver** → Complete the delivery
5. **Store Manager** → Confirm receipt

See the deployed application and `/docs` for the full walkthrough.

## 🏆 Tech-Triathlon 2026

Waypoint is built across the three stages of the challenge:

**Designathon** → Design the experience
**Hackathon** → Build the platform
**Datathon** → Predict and optimize
