# Nexora - Waypoint

> **Smarter decisions. Better deliveries.**

Waypoint is an intelligent delivery planning and operations platform built for Waypoint Group as part of **Tech-Triathlon 2026**.

It connects the complete delivery workflow in one system:

**Order → Plan → Allocate → Load → Deliver → Confirm**

Instead of relying on spreadsheets, phone calls, and printed run sheets, Waypoint gives dispatchers, loaders, drivers, and store managers a shared operational view.

---

## 🚚 What Waypoint Solves

Waypoint helps manage a delivery network where capacity is limited and every decision matters.

The platform considers:

- Vehicle weight & volume capacity
- Refrigerated / ambient requirements
- Outlet access restrictions
- Delivery windows
- Depot & district constraints
- Vehicle trip limits
- Order deferrals
- Delivery progress
- Offline field operations

When demand exceeds capacity, Waypoint doesn't just defer an order — it records **why** and keeps the decision traceable.

## 🧠 Intelligent Planning

Waypoint's allocation engine evaluates operational constraints before assigning orders to vehicles and trips.

```text

  └── Deferred

```

The goal is not simply to find a plan — but to create a **feasible and explainable plan**.

## 📡 Built for the Real World

Drivers may lose connectivity while on the road.

Waypoint supports offline delivery operations, allowing drivers to record delivery events and proof of delivery locally before synchronizing when connectivity returns.

Online → Offline → Work Locally → Reconnect → Sync
```

## 📊 Predictive Intelligence

The Datathon component explores:

* Delivery service-time prediction
* Late-arrival probability
* Future demand forecasting
* Peak-day fleet allocation

These capabilities can help Waypoint plan ahead instead of reacting after problems occur.

## ⚡ Getting Started

```bash
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd <REPOSITORY_NAME>

cp .env.example .env

docker compose up
```

Docker Compose starts the application, database, and seed data.

---

## 🎯 Judge Walkthrough

The complete workflow can be demonstrated using the seeded accounts:

1. **Store Manager** → Create an order
2. **Dispatcher** → Plan and allocate deliveries
3. **Loader** → Load the assigned vehicle
4. **Driver** → Complete the delivery
5. **Store Manager** → Confirm receipt

See the deployed application and `/docs` for the full walkthrough.

## 🏬 Store Manager (Waypoint Store)

The store manager role, built in `frontend/`. Branch: `feature/store-manager-frontend`.

**Status:** in progress. Phases 1 to 3 are done; phases 4 to 8 are not started.

### How to run

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The store role is not yet routed (phase 7). Once routed, it will live at
`/store/orders`, `/store/deliveries`, `/store/deliveries/:date/receipt` and
`/store/issues`, with a dev-only state gallery at `/store/_states` and a
`?at=HH:MM` scenario clock.

### Phase list

| Phase | What lands | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Vite, React and TypeScript scaffold; tokens.css; base.css; fonts; Radix and fontsource dependencies | Done |
| 2 | Shared primitives: Button, StatusPill, Tag, Alert, Card, Sheet, Modal, Toast, TopBar, AppBar, TabBar, ConnectivityBar, StateScreen, JourneyTimeline, Facts, DataTable | Done |
| 3 | Order types, the 11 statuses and `statusLabel`, the `StoreApi` interface and mock with the hero fixture, cutoff and arrival-range rules | Done |
| 4 | S1 Place order: all states, edit and cancel until 16:00, after cutoff, offline, error, sending, empty, desktop form and review modal | Not started |
| 5 | S2 Deliveries: every state, Under review card, deferral notices, OUT009, recent orders, desktop | Not started |
| 6 | S3 Receipt and the Issues tab: confirm, shortfall, issue sheet, Dispatch asks, the open-review branch, states | Not started |
| 7 | Routes, the state gallery, the scenario clock | Not started |
| 8 | README update and a final lint, type and build pass | Not started |

### Departures from the Figma design

None yet. No store screens are built (phases 4 to 6 are not started), so
there is nothing to compare against the Day 5 Figma frames. This section
will list every visual or copy difference from the store Figma page as each
screen lands, with its reason, per the booklet's fidelity requirement.

### Assumptions and data notes

- **PRD v2 assumption A1** (operating day Tue 29 Sep 2026) cannot be checked
  against the shipped `calendar.csv`: that file runs 2024-01-01 to
  2026-06-28 and does not reach September 2026. Every non-operating day in
  the covered range is a Sunday, which matches the booklet's Monday to
  Saturday schedule, so the hero date is treated as an operating day on
  that basis rather than a dataset lookup. See PRD v2 section 4d, A1, for
  the full note. This does not affect any screen or rule, since operating
  days follow the weekday rule, not a calendar row.
- **Scenario clock deferred to phase 7.** `createMockStoreApi` (phase 3)
  takes a `now: () => Date` function so its cutoff and arrival-release
  checks can be driven by the `?at=HH:MM` scenario clock later, but nothing
  reads that query param yet — the mock defaults to real time until routing
  (phase 7) wires it up.

### Shared files this role has changed

- `frontend/src/styles/tokens.css`: copied from `feature/dispatcher-frontend`
  unchanged, then checked against the live Figma variable collection. No
  values changed. Appended the type, space and size scale from PRD v2
  section 6, additive only.
- `frontend/tsconfig.app.json`: matches the dispatcher branch's strictness
  settings (no `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` or `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`,
  which fight CSS Modules' generated types).
- `frontend/tsconfig.node.json`: **not yet reconciled.** This branch sets
  `"module": "esnext"` with `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`; the dispatcher
  branch sets `"module": "nodenext"` with no resolution override. Both
  compile `vite.config.ts` today, so this is not blocking, but the two
  should be aligned before the branches share a `tsconfig.node.json`.

Dependency versions in `frontend/package.json` are pinned to match
`feature/dispatcher-frontend` exactly where both branches use a package, so
the two merge without a version conflict. Two exceptions: this role adds
`@radix-ui/react-dialog` and `@radix-ui/react-toast` (not yet used on the
dispatcher branch), and uses `@fontsource-variable/archivo` in place of the
dispatcher's `@fontsource/archivo`, per this build's font requirement.
